Our mission is to build the infrastructure required for developing modern decentralized & peer-to-peer (P2P) applications that are free from centralized rent-seeking.

We achieve this by providing open-source software tools that can be used with our interoperable Fetch decentralized network. Using these tools and the Fetch.ai blockchain network, you can harness the power of AI and automation to carry out complex coordination in the digital economy.
